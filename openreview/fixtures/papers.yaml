    abstract: '  ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive MOdeling) is a software
      for

      modeling biological networks, such as e.g. signaling, metabolic or gene

      networks. An ANIMO model is essentially the sum of a network topology and a

      number of interaction parameters. The topology describes the interactions

      between biological entities in form of a graph, while the parameters determine

      the speed of occurrence of such interactions. When a mismatch is observed

      between the behavior of an ANIMO model and experimental data, we want to update

      the model so that it explains the new data. In general, the topology of a model

      can be expanded with new (known or hypothetical) nodes, and enables it to match

      experimental data. However, the unrestrained addition of new parts to a model

      causes two problems: models can become too complex too fast, to the point of

      being intractable, and too many parts marked as "hypothetical" or "not known"

      make a model unrealistic. Even if changing the topology is normally the easier

      task, these problems push us to try a better parameter fit as a first step,
      and

      resort to modifying the model topology only as a last resource. In this paper

      we show the support added in ANIMO to ease the task of expanding the knowledge

      on biological networks, concentrating in particular on the parameter settings.

      pore complex or the actin cytoskeleton is strongly determined by their spatial

      nature of protein assembly is also an essential element for their biological

      function. Here we introduce a computational approach for the Brownian dynamics

      of patchy particles with anisotropic assemblies and fully reversible reactions.

      Different particles stochastically associate and dissociate with microscopic

      reaction rates depending on their relative spatial positions. The translational

      and rotational diffusive properties of all protein complexes are evaluated

      on-the-fly. Because we focus on reversible assembly, we introduce a scheme

      which ensures detailed balance for patchy particles. We then show how the

      macroscopic rates follow from the microscopic ones. As an instructive example,

      we study the assembly of a pentameric ring structure, for which we find

      excellent agreement between simulation results and a macroscopic kinetic

      description without any adjustable parameters. This demonstrates that our

      approach correctly accounts for both the diffusive and reactive processes

    abstract: '  We embed spherical Rindler space -- a geometry with a spherical hole
      in its

      center -- in asymptotically AdS spacetime and show that it carries a

      gravitational entropy proportional to the area of the hole. Spherical

      AdS-Rindler space is holographically dual to an ultraviolet sector of the

      boundary field theory given by restriction to a strip of finite duration in

      time. Because measurements have finite durations, local observers in the field

      theory can only access information about bounded spatial regions. We propose
      a

      notion of Residual Entropy that captures uncertainty about the state of a

      system left by the collection of local, finite-time observables. For

      two-dimensional conformal field theories we use holography and the strong

      subadditivity of entanglement to propose a formula for Residual Entropy and

      show that it precisely reproduces the areas of circular holes in AdS3.

      Extending the notion to field theories on strips with variable durations in

      time, we show more generally that Residual Entropy computes the areas of all

      closed, inhomogenous curves on a spatial slice of AdS3. We discuss the

      extension to higher dimensional field theories, the relation of Residual

      Entropy to entanglement between scales, and some implications for the emergence

      of space from the RG flow of entangled field theories.

    abstract: '  Following transmission, HIV-1 evolves into a diverse population,
      and next

      generation sequencing enables us to detect variants occurring at low

      frequencies. Studying viral evolution at the level of whole genomes was

      hitherto not possible because next generation sequencing delivers relatively

      short reads. We here provide a proof of principle that whole HIV-1 genomes can

      be reliably reconstructed from short reads, and use this to study the selection

      of immune escape mutations at the level of whole genome haplotypes. Using

      realistically simulated HIV-1 populations, we demonstrate that reconstruction

      of complete genome haplotypes is feasible with high fidelity. We do not

      reconstruct all genetically distinct genomes, but each reconstructed haplotype

      represents one or more of the quasispecies in the HIV-1 population. We then

      reconstruct 30 whole genome haplotypes from published short sequence reads

      sampled longitudinally from a single HIV-1 infected patient. We confirm the

      reliability of the reconstruction by validating our predicted haplotype genes

      with single genome amplification sequences, and by comparing haplotype

      frequencies with observed epitope escape frequencies. Phylogenetic analysis

      shows that the HIV-1 population undergoes selection driven evolution, with

      successive replacement of the viral population by novel dominant strains. We

      demonstrate that immune escape mutants evolve in a dependent manner with

      various mutations hitchhiking along with others. As a consequence of this

      clonal interference, selection coefficients have to be estimated for complete

      haplotypes and not for individual immune escapes.

    abstract: '  Community detection, which aims to cluster N nodes in a given graph
      into r

      distinct groups based on the observed undirected edges, is an important problem

      in network data analysis. In this paper, the popular stochastic block model

      (SBM) is extended to the generalized stochastic block model (GSBM) that allows

      for adversarial outlier nodes, which are connected with other nodes in the

      graph in an arbitrary way. Under this model, we introduce a procedure using

      convex optimization followed by k-means algorithm with k = r. Both theoretical

      and numerical properties of the method are analyzed. A theoretical guarantee
      is

      given for our methodology to accurately detect the communities with small

      misclassification rate under the setting where the number of clusters can grow

      with N. This theoretical result admits to the best known result in the

      literature of computationally feasible community detection. Numerical results

      show that our method is both computationally fast and robust to different kinds

      of outliers, while some popular computationally fast community detection

      algorithms, such as spectral clustering applied to adjacency matrices or graph

      Laplacians, may fail due to a very small portion of outliers. We apply a slight

      modification of our method to a political blogs data set, showing that our

      method is competent in practice, and comparable to existing computationally

      feasible methods in the literature. To the best of the authors'' knowledge,
      our

      result is the first in the literature in terms of clustering communities with

      fast growing numbers under the generalized stochastic block model where a

      portion of arbitrary outlier nodes exist.

      aim was to understand processes in propagation VLF/LF radio signals over short

      paths, and to estimate specific characteristics of each short path. The

      receiver at Belgrade station continuously monitor the amplitude and phase of

      coherent and subionospherically propagating LF signal operated in Sicily, NSC

      at 45.90, kHz and VLF signal operated in Isola di Tavolara ICV at 20.27 kHz,

      with great circle distances of 953 km and 976 km, respectively. Geographical

      locations of transmitters and receiver site result that these short paths have

      many similarity. The main difference is in transmitter frequencies. In period

      from 2008 to February 2014 were selected around 200 events for further

      examination. In all selected examples amplitude and phase on VLF and LF signals

      were perturbed by occurrence of solar X-ray flares. This six years period

      covers minimum and maximum of solar activity. Also, simultaneous measurement
      of

      amplitude and phase on the VLF/LF signals during occurrence of solar flare were

      employed for constructing electron density profile versus altitude and also

      member states, China, and the United States have been represented differently

      as a result of using different databases. An analytical variant of the

      Web-of-Science (of Thomson Reuters) enables us to study the dynamics in the

      world publication system in terms of the field-normalized top-1% and top-10%

      most-frequently-cited publications. Comparing the EU28, USA, and China at the

      global level shows a top-level dynamics that is different from the analysis
      in

      terms of shares of publications: the United States remains far more productive

      in the top-1% of all papers; China drops out of the competition for elite

      status; and the EU28 increased its share among the top-cited papers from

      2000-2010. Some of the EU28 member states overtook the U.S. during this decade,

      but a clear divide remains between EU15 (Western Europe) and the Accession

      Countries. Network analysis shows that internationally co-authored top-1%

      publications perform far above expectation and also above top-10% ones. In

      2005, China was embedded in this top-layer of internationally co-authored

      publications. These publications often involve more than a single European

    abstract: '  This paper examines the proximity of authors to those they cite using
      degrees

      of separation in a co-author network, essentially using collaboration networks

      to expand on the notion of self-citations. While the proportion of direct

      self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is

      relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10%

      of citations) and the social sciences (20%), the same cannot be said for

      citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences

      between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship

      which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also

      in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining
      a

      propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network.

      Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration

      network, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references,

      we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms
      of

      the knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have

      implications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of

      citation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific

      disciplines over the past 50 years. In addition, our findings have important

      practical implications for the availability of ''arm''s length'' expert reviewers

      of grant applications and manuscripts.

    abstract: '  There is considerable debate whether the domestic political institutions

      (specifically, the country s level of democracy) of the host developing country

      toward foreign investors are effective in establishing the credibility of

      commitments are still underway, researchers have also analyzed the effect of

      international institutions such as (GATT-WTO) membership and Bilateral

      Investment treaties (BIT) in their role of establishing the credibility of

      commitment to attract foreign investments. We argue that there are qualitative

      differences among various types of trade agreements and full-fledged trade

      agreements (FTA-CU) provide credibility to foreign investors and democracy

      level in the host country conditions this effect whereas the partial scope

      agreements (PSA) are not sufficient in providing credibility of commitments
      and

      not moderated by democracy. This paper analyses the impact of heterogeneous

      TAs, and their interaction with domestic institutions, on FDI inflows.

      Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2005 support

      this argument. The method adopted relies on fixed effects estimator which is

      robust to control endogeneity on a large panel dataset. The strict erogeneity

      of results by using a method suggested by Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and no

      feedback effect found in sample. The results state that (1) More the FTA-CU

      concluded, larger the amount of FDI inflows are attracted into the developing

      countries and PSA are insignificant in determining the FDI inflow; (2) FTA CU

      are complementary to democratic regime whereas the conditional effect of PSA

      with democracy on levels of FDI inflows is insignificant.

    abstract: "  Quantitative theories of information flow give us an approach to\
      \ relax the\nabsolute confidentiality properties that are difficult to satisfy\
      \ for many\npractical programs. The classical information-theoretic approaches\
      \ for\nsequential programs, where the program is modeled as a communication\
      \ channel\nwith only input and output, and the measure of leakage is based on\
      \ the notions\nof initial uncertainty and remaining uncertainty after observing\
      \ the final\noutcomes, are not suitable to multi-threaded programs. Besides,\
      \ the\ninformation-theoretic approaches have been also shown to conflict with\
      \ each\nother when comparing programs. Reasoning about the exposed information\
      \ flow of\nmulti-threaded programs is more complicated, since the outcomes of\
      \ such\nprograms depend on the scheduler policy, and the leakages in intermediate\n\
      states also contribute to the overall leakage of the program.\n  This paper\
      \ proposes a novel model of quantitative analysis for multi-threaded\nprograms\
      \ that also takes into account the effect of observables in intermediate\nstates\
      \ along the trace. We define a notion of the leakage of a program trace.\nGiven\
      \ the fact that the execution of a multi-threaded program is typically\ndescribed\
      \ by a set of traces, the leakage of a program under a specific\nscheduler is\
      \ computed as the expected value of the leakages of all possible\ntraces. Examples\
      \ are given to compare our approach with the existing\napproaches.\n"

    abstract: "  Turing progressions have been often used to measure the proof-theoretic\n\
      strength of mathematical theories. Turing progressions based on $n$-provability\n\
      give rise to a $\\Pi_{n+1}$ proof-theoretic ordinal. As such, to each theory\
      \ $U$\nwe can assign the sequence of corresponding $\\Pi_{n+1}$ ordinals $\\\
      langle\n|U|_n\\rangle_{n>0}$. We call this sequence a \\emph{Turing-Taylor expansion}\

      \ of Peano\nArithmetic to Ignatiev's universal model for the closed fragment\
      \ of the\npolymodal provability logic ${\\mathbf{GLP}}_\\omega$. In particular,\
      \ in this\nfirst draft we observe that each point in the Ignatiev model can\
      \ be seen as\nTuring-Taylor expansions of formal mathematical theories.\n  Moreover,\
      \ each sub-theory of Peano Arithmetic that allows for a Turing-Taylor\nexpression\

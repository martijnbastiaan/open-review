      We establish adiabatic theorems with and without spectral gap condition for general operators
      A(t):D(A(t))⊂X→X with possibly time-dependent domains in a Banach space X. We first prove
      adiabatic theorems with uniform and non-uniform spectral gap condition (including a slightly
      extended adiabatic theorem of higher order). In these adiabatic theorems the considered
      spectral subsets σ(t) have only to be compact -- in particular, they need not consist of
      eigenvalues. We then prove an adiabatic theorem without spectral gap condition for not
      necessarily (weakly) semisimple eigenvalues: in essence, it is only required there that the
      considered spectral subsets σ(t)={λ(t)} consist of eigenvalues λ(t)∈∂σ(A(t)) and that there
      exist projections P(t) reducing A(t) such that A(t)|P(t)D(A(t))−λ(t) is nilpotent and
      A(t)|(1−P(t))D(A(t))−λ(t) is injective with dense range in (1−P(t))X for almost every~t.
      In all these theorems, the regularity conditions imposed on t↦A(t), σ(t), P(t) are fairly
      mild. We explore the strength of the presented adiabatic theorems in numerous examples.
      And finally, we apply the adiabatic theorems for time-dependent domains to obtain -- in a
      very simple way -- adiabatic theorems for operators A(t) defined by symmetric sesquilinear
      forms.

      The scatter in the apparent magnitude of type Ia supernovae induced by stochastic
      gravitational lensing is highly dependent on the nonlinear growth of cosmological
      structure. In this paper, we show that such a dependence can potentially be employed
      to gain significant information about the mass clustering at small scales. While the
      mass clustering ultimately hinges on cosmology, here we demonstrate that, upon obtaining
      more precise observational measurements through future cosmological surveys, the
      lensing dispersion can very effectively be used to gain information on the poorly
      understood astrophysical aspects of structure formation, such as the clumpiness of
      dark matter halos and the importance of gas physics and star formation into shaping
      the large-scale structure. In order to illustrate this point we verify that even the
      tentative current measurements of the lensing dispersion performed on the Supernova
      Legacy Survey sample favor a scenario where virialized structures are somewhat less
      compact than predicted by n−body cosmological simulations. Moreover, we are also
      able to put lower limits on the slope of the concentration-mass relation. By
      artificially reducing the statistical observational error we argue that with forthcoming
      data the stochastic lensing dispersion will allow one to importantly improve constraints
      on the baryonic physics at work during the assembly of cosmological structure.
